**Attention Lens v5 Users:**

If you're using Lens v5 to access cronjobs in our Kubernetes namespace, you might encounter the following error due to our recent Kubernetes upgrade to version 1.27: 

**"The server could not find the requested resource."**

As you may be aware, this Kubernetes update introduces a breaking change for cronjobs, switching the API version to `batch/v1`.

To resolve this, you need to update Lens to the new version called **OpenLens** (an open-source project). 

**Instructions:**

1. Go to **Home | DEVPORTAL (group.socgen)**
2. Upgrade Lens using `envinstall`

**Note:** We are not the maintainers of Lens.

Best regards,

Feel free to ask if you need any more adjustments!
